I don't know

I feel really sad most of the time. I know I'm not good at this job and I know I'll either leave or be fired. Firing would be better because at least there's a chance I'd get unemployment. I can't afford to leave on my own, but I know they'd be better off without me. I'm not a good fit for this culture or this position, and I wish I'd realized that earlier on. As it stands, I feel like I need to stick around till April at least, if only because I know replacing me would be difficult at the moment, even with all the gross mistakes I make. I wish I could be the person they need me to be but most of the criticism isn't helpful. "Slow down" when I know I made the mistake after looking as meticulously as I could. "If you're unsure, please just ask me" when I was absolutely confident I did the right thing at the time. All I'm doing is losing confidence in my ability to hold a job. Will I be able to continue after I leave? Am I basically just going to be someone's problem for every place I get hired in? I regret everything.

Anyway, this repository is a test to try before creating a code that will check some data pulled from our website.
